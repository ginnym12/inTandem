     <p class="wowfadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4">We are embarking upon a journey across the North American continent in search of people; people to meet, to talk to, to share with, to exist with. Above all else, we seek Connection. We seek to foster connections specifically with peoples who are marginalized, underserved, and stratified by a system which instills a very biased, rigid, convoluted idea of what it means to be a person of worth. We hope to use music - playing and sharing music - as a means of emitting and expressing energies of loving kindness that will serve to establish connections between us and our listeners. In addition to playing music for people, we seek to meet other people who wish to express themselves through the vehicle of music, and collaborate in creating and playing original musical compositions. We will be traveling with a mobile, minimalist recording studio, in order to record the music that we hope to make with the people we meet.</p>
     <p class="wowfadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4">Upon the conclusion of our trip, we hope to construct a consolidated work of the music shared by those who we meet on our travels, as well as any music we were inspired to create through the journey. This work will be produced and distributed publicly, with the intention of generating support for those who took a part in its creation, through both monetary contributions, and the establishment of a listener base for these aspiring artists. We will be filming the trip in hopes of ascertaining some final production of videography which illustrates the lives of those we meet and have the opportunity to form a relationship with - their stories, struggles, sentiments, hopes, dreams - which we hope will provide the viewer with a deepened understanding for his or her own privileges, in an effort to generate some sense of love, compassion, and empathy with the world, whether it be for one moment, or a lifetime.</p>

My perceived purpose in life is to create for all people in the hope that it will bring them a clearer sense of themselves. I spend most of my time creating furniture, textiles, works of art, drawings and music with the intention of allowing people to appreciate a singular moment for exactly what it is: a moment. My hope is to bring clarity and appreciation to the natural world and to the people who inhabit it through well made, thoughtfully composed artifacts and experiences.
Eric and I are going on this trip to serve the world with compassion, music, and art. We wish to share ourselves with everyone we encounter with the hope that our love and excitement for sharing will spread as well. <br>I believe that there is an artist hidden deep inside all of us. Introducing people to different forms of expression in an encouraging environment allows their inner artist to blossom,  the world benefits. I believe that we are all equal, in this sense I believe that we all deserve to feel comfortable and able to express ourselves in all environments. If I go out into the world and express myself as openly and as wildly as I possibly can, hopefully this will inspire others to follow suit." id="teamImg">

Our hearts beat for the same reason that leaves grow on the trees. We must acknowledge the humbling beauty of our being as a part of the greater whole of existence, and find ways to preserve, promote, and empower modes of being which yield more fulfilling and loving lives for all living things.

          <li><b>FILM:</b> We will produce a film which details our experiences of the trip, the people we meet on the trip, and displays these people and our experiences in an organic way which illustrates our mutual connections as people existing in the same time and space.</li>
          <li><b>ALBUM:</b> We will produce a musical production which comprises a compilation of songs written/played/recorded by us and those we meet on our travels. We will distribute / sell this album, and <b>donate all of the proceeds to those who helped create the album.</b></li>

        <p style="text-align:left;">Maybe you believe in our vision, maybe you are one of our friends/family/loved ones, or maybe you just think it's funny that we're riding across the country on a tandem bicycle. Regardless of who you are, <b>we need your help</b>. Our fundraising goal is
          <b>5,000.00</b>. If you would like to make a monetary donation, please consider contributing to our CrowdRise. If you or your business would like to get involved as a sponsor, please continue to the Contact page and drop us a line! In an effort to maintain financial transparency, we have included a link
          to a detailed expense report listing the planned expenses we are fundraising for. We will continue to update the expense list to the best of our ability throughout the duration of our trip.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">**<b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>** Upon the completion of our journey we plan on donating the tandem bike and related equipment to a non-profit in San Francisco (our end location).</p>
